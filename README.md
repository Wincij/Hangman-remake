# Hangman-remake
Hangman game remake. This time I used PyQt5 library

Basicly, hangman is pure Python3. To run you will need only PyQt5 module. The hidden word is one from `words/words.txt`. 



The easist way to run it is install all requirements and run it by command line:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
`python3 hangman.py`

In future I will try to make this game executable or maybe even multilingual.

Hope you will enjoy it :)
